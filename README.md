<h1 align="center">STM32F4xx Drivers</h1>
<p>
</p>

> These are custom GPIO, I2c, SPI and UART drivers for stm32f4xx devices. They are not CMSIS compatible as I made them completely from scratch.
> They were made for educational purposes and to familiarize myself with the stm32 platform and the basics of peripherals communications.

> The project was made on STM32CubeIDE.

## Testing
> They were tested on a STM32F446RE nucleo board and for the communication I used an Arduino UNO.
